## ResNet50-LungCancer-Detection
This project implements the ResNet50 architecture uses it to classify chest cancer from CT scan images. 

### Project Highlights
 Classification of Chest CT scan images into 4 categories
 Training Monitoring with accuracy/loss visualization
 Includes L2 Regularization, Dropout, EarlyStopping, and ReduceLROnPlateau

### Introduction to ResNet
Residual Networks (ResNets) are deep convolutional neural networks that solve the vanishing gradient problem by introducing skip connections, allowing gradients to flow more effectively in deep architectures.

### Dataset
Source: Kaggle - Chest CT-scan Images

Structure: Pre-organized into train, valid, and test folders

Classes: 4 chest-related conditions

### Conclusion
This project demonstrates the efficacy of a ResNet50 architecture from scratch in classifying CT scan images for chest cancer detection. The combination of residual learning, data augmentation, and regularization techniques makes it robust for real-world medical imaging tasks.
