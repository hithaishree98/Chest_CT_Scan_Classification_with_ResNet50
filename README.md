### ResNet50-ChestCancer-Detection
This project implements the ResNet50 architecture from scratch and uses it to classify chest cancer from CT scan images. It leverages both a fully custom residual network and transfer learning approaches to achieve high classification accuracy on the Chest CT-scan Images dataset.

## Project Highlights
 Custom ResNet50 architecture implemented from scratch using TensorFlow/Keras
 Transfer Learning support using pretrained ImageNet weights (optional)
 Classification of Chest CT scan images into 4 categories
 Training Monitoring with accuracy/loss visualization
 Includes L2 Regularization, Dropout, EarlyStopping, and ReduceLROnPlateau

## Introduction to ResNet
Residual Networks (ResNets) are deep convolutional neural networks that solve the vanishing gradient problem by introducing skip connections, allowing gradients to flow more effectively in deep architectures.

## Dataset
Source: Kaggle - Chest CT-scan Images

Structure: Pre-organized into train, valid, and test folders
